## Learning Logs

Students should have 10 Learning Logs by the end of the semester. Plan on doing one every week. Every student will also give at least one five-minute Learning Log presentation for the class.

Learning Logs can be around any client-side web topic we have covered in class where you need more clarity or want a deeper dive. I will update the [resources](resources.md) page with suggestions as the course moves forward.

To submit a Learning Log:


Post to Discord in the #learning-logs channel for this course. Begin message with "#LL: descriptive name" (where descriptive name is a title that describes your learning log).

* Identify (name, URL, sections, etc.) at least one tutorial that you did, and respond to the following.

* Instances where you achieved clarity, i.e. understood something or felt pieces of knowledge falling into place towards a greater understanding.

* Instances where you did NOT achieve clarity and why. What can you do to aid your understanding?

* Connections you made among the week’s readings, lectures, class activities, homework assignments, etc.

(The tutorial you do could also be via a book—in that case, list the name of the book instead of the URL, and include the chapter and pages.)
