Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. In any learning situation you should study beforehand, make/do, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again. Learning happens in a cycle.

You will synthesize what you are noticing in your notes, assignments, projects, learning logs, etc. with regard to your learning. Each self assessment should have a minimum of three citations from lectures, weekly discussions, and/or tutorials. Write a narrative midterm self-evaluation that is a minimum of 2 paragraphs. (You certainly may write more.)

In this narrative, address the following:

    * What do I know about this subject right now?

    * What has my journey looked like?

    * How has my learning affected my understanding of what I can create with these tools? How has my learning affected what I may be inspired to create?

    * What can I do to remain engaged, inspired and productive?

Do 2 things with this narrative:

    1) Save it to your computer for you to reflect upon at the end of the semester.

    2) Copy/paste your text into the text box provided on the Midterm Assessment assignment on NYU Classes.
