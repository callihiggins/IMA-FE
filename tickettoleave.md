## TICKET TO LEAVE

At the end of each class period, before you leave:

Post to Discrod in the "#ticket-to-leave" channel.

Respond to 1 or both of the following:

* List at least 1 thing you learned today in class.

* What concept(s) confuses you from today’s lecture, discussion, or exercises? (This will give you a clue as to what you should study before the next class.)
